Hi everyone, we're excited announce what's probably the largest update to vexide yet. vexide is a Rust library for programming VEX robots, empowering you to write safe and efficient code for your robot in the Rust programming language.

<!--
Rust Standard Library Support: Users can now use APIs from `std`, as well as crates that depend on std itself. This opens up the possibility of using an even larger portion of the Rust ecosystem: trace your robot with the `foxglove` crate or create a path-following algorithm with `optimization_engine`.

Improved Dev Experience: vexide is easier to use than ever with new features like task-locals and optional embedded-io support. Plus, customize as desired by choosing your own SDK, toggling vexide's new Cargo features, etc.
