vexide v0.8 is a new version of the runtime including improvements such as: support for the Rust Standard Library, new async runtime APIs, support for encoders with custom resolutions, the option to use the official VEX SDK, and various bug fixes. While we have aimed to minimize breaking changes, you will need to update your existing projects to make them compatible with this new release.

# Automatic Upgrade Tool

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Like everything else, this is experimental, so back up your project and let us know when it doesn't work!

If you'd like to upgrade a project from v0.7 to v0.8, you can use our automatic upgrade tool to do much of the hard part for you:

```sh
cargo v5 upgrade
```

This will handle updating vexide, enabling the Rust Standard Library, and updating your project's Cargo configuration. However, it won't handle any changes to vexide's API, so if you encounter any build errors after the update, consult the [API Changes](#api-changes) section.

You'll need to have the latest version of cargo-v5 installed to use this command, so make sure to update it beforehand. **We also strongly suggest testing the upgrade on a separate branch**, then merging it once you've reviewed the changes to your code and verified that they work.

Even if you run the upgrade tool with no complications, we still recommend reading through all of the [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes-guide) included in v0.8 to get a good idea of what's changed and make sure the upgrade tool didn't miss anything.

# Manual Upgrade Guide

Here's a comprehensive guide on upgrading to vexide v0.8 from v0.7. Apart from the [API Changes](#api-changes), most of these differences can be handled by our [Automatic Upgrade Tool](#automatic-upgrade-tool).

If you'd rather start a new project than upgrade your current one, check out our updated [template project](https://github.com/vexide/vexide-template/tree/vexide-0.8.0). (Clicking "Use this template" will use the stable version, but you can still download the zip file or clone the pre-release branch.)

## Update cargo-v5

Install the pre-release of cargo-v5.

```sh
cargo install --git "https://github.com/vexide/cargo-v5.git" --branch upstreamed-target
```

## Update Rust

Update your `rust-toolchain.toml` file to install a newer version of Rust.

```toml title="rust-toolchain.toml"
[toolchain]
# @diff +
channel = "nightly-2025-09-26"
# @diff -
channel = "nightly"
components = ["rust-src"]
```

## Update vexide

To use vexide v0.8, you'll need to update it in your dependencies table, then choose which SDKs you'd like to enable. Use the configuration below to keep your project's existing behavior.

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
# @fold start
[package]
name = "my-vexide-project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

[package.metadata.v5]
upload-strategy = "differential"
slot = 1
icon = "cool-x"
compress = true

# @fold end
[dependencies]
# @diff -
vexide = "0.7.0"

# @diff + start
[dependencies.vexide]
version = "0.8.0-alpha.2"
features = ["full", "vex-sdk-jumptable", "vex-sdk-mock"]
# @diff + end
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're updating a library that uses vexide, don't enable `full`
> or any of the `vex-sdk-*` features. <br /> Please read the
> [vexide features guide](/docs/features/) for more information.

## Enable Standard Library Support

In vexide v0.8, projects use Rust's new builtin support for VEX V5 devices. As a result, you may now use the comprehensive [Rust&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Library][std]&nbsp;(`std`) in your vexide projects! Enable it by taking the following steps:

[std]: https://docs.rs/std

Update `.cargo/config.toml` to use Rust's builtin VEX V5 support and enable the standard library.

```toml title=".cargo/config.toml"
# @diff - start
[build]
target = "./armv7a-vex-v5.json"
# @diff - end

[unstable]
# @diff +
#           (                   )
build-std = ["std", "panic_abort"]
# @diff -
#           (                                    )
build-std = ["core", "compiler_builtins", "alloc"]
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]
```

Delete the old `armv7a-vex-v5.json` target file.

```jsonc title="armv7a-vex-v5.json"
// @diff - start
{
    "cpu": "cortex-a9",
    "arch": "arm",
    "abi": "eabihf",
    // ...etc...
}
// @diff - end
```

Update your project's source code to allow importing from the standard library.

```rs title="src/main.rs"
// @diff -
#![no_main]
// @diff -
#![no_std]

// @diff -
extern crate alloc;

use vexide::prelude::*;

#[vexide::main]
async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Enable vexide's Custom Memory Layout

In order to support features like differential uploading and async task-locals, vexide v0.8 requires all projects to enable its custom memory layout in the Cargo config file:

```toml title=".config/cargo.toml"
# @diff + start
[target.'cfg(target_os = "vexos")']
rustflags = ["-Clink-arg=-Tvexide.ld"]
# @diff + end

[unstable]
build-std = ["std", "panic_abort"]
build-std-features = ["compiler-builtins-mem"]
```

# API Changes

> [!NOTE]
>
> We haven't completely updated this yet, so check out the
> [vexide changelog](https://github.com/vexide/vexide/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
> if you think anything's missing.

## Position Arithmetic

`Position` structs are now internally represented as floating point values.

```rs
let pos1 = Position::from_degrees(90.0);

// @diff - start
let pos2 = pos1 / 2;
let pos3 = pos1 * 2;
// @diff - end

// @diff + start
let pos2 = pos1 / 2.0;
let pos3 = pos1 * 2.0;
// @diff + end
```

## ADI Encoder Ticks

The `AdiEncoder` struct now requires you to specify a custom encoder Ticks Per Revolution value. To keep the old behavior, use `AdiOpticalEncoder`.

```rs
// @diff -
let encoder = AdiEncoder::new(peripherals.adi_a, peripherals.adi_b);

// @diff +
let encoder = AdiOpticalEncoder::new(peripherals.adi_a, peripherals.adi_b);
```

## Gyroscope Yaw Format

The `AdiGyroscope` struct now returns its yaw in degrees.

```rs
let gyro = AdiGyroscope::new(peripherals.adi_a);

// @diff -
let yaw_pos = gyro.yaw()?;
// @diff +
let yaw_pos = Position::from_degrees(gyro.yaw()?);
```

## Rotation Sensor Calculation Interval

The function for changing the calculation interval of a `RotationSensor` was renamed from `set_computation_interval` to `set_data_interval`.

```rs
let mut sensor = RotationSensor::new(peripherals.port_1, Direction::Forward);
let interval = Duration::from_millis(10);

// @diff -
sensor.set_computation_interval(interval)?;
// @diff +
sensor.set_data_interval(interval)?;
```

## Buffer stride removed

The `Display::draw_buffer` function no longer takes a stride argument.

```rs
let buf: &[u32] = [
    0, 0, 0, 0, // row 1
    // ...etc...
];
let region = Rect::new([1, 1], [4, 4]);


// @diff -
let width = 1 + region.end.x - region.start.x;
// @diff -
//                             (     )
display.draw_buffer(region, buf, width);
// @diff +
display.draw_buffer(region, buf);
```

## Manual usage of startup function

> [!NOTE]
> This is an advanced feature and it is unlikely your project is affected. If you use the
> `#[vexide::main]` attribute, this change does not affect your project.

The `vexide::startup::startup()` function no longer handles printing vexide's banner message.

If you are manually calling `vexide::startup::startup()`, you will need to explicitly print vexide's banner to keep the previous behavior.

```rs
unsafe {
    // @diff -
    //                      (      )
    vexide::startup::startup::<true>();

    // @diff +
    vexide::startup::startup();
    // @diff +
    vexide::startup::banner::print();
}
```
