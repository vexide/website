# Welcome!

These resources serve as an introduction and set of tutorials for using vexide and its tools, which allow you to write Rust programs for VEX robots. If you're already familiar with vexide or prefer references over tutorials we also have complete [API documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/vexide).

> [!TIP]
> It should be stated that this is NOT a Rust tutorial, so it's recommended for you to go through at least the first half of the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or some other learning resource if you aren't familiar with Rust. We'll try to keep things as simple as possible, but this documentation assumes that you have a basic understanding of [variables](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html), [functions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html), [data types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html), [control flow](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html), [ownership/borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html), and [traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-00-generics.html).

> [!WARNING]
> **These docs are still under construction!** Many features of vexide [exist](https://docs.rs/vexide), but are not yet documented in these pages.

# What is vexide?

vexide is a Rust library for programming VEX robots: it provides a platform for running Rust code on the VEX brain that controls your robot's hardware and devices. You can think of it as an alternative to [VEXcode](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexcode) or [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), but for the Rust programming language (rather than C or C++). vexide implements low-level features like task scheduling, memory allocation, and competition state so that you can write competitive, performant, and reliable code!

# Why should I use this?

<ins>vexide is not for everyone</ins>, and it's particularly not geared towards beginner programmers. That being said, it offers many unique benefits to users hoping to safely utilize the full potential of their robot's systems when programming.

## Rust is a pretty neat language.

![ferris standing next to some crates](/docs/crates.svg)

Rust is a modern programming language that is growing in popularity due to its reliability, speed, and developer experience. Because of this, it's used today in fields like networking, graphics & systems programming, and embedded platforms development. If you've been looking for a chance to learn and use it in a project also enjoy robotics, then vexide is the perfect opportunity for you to pick it up! vexide's API takes heavy inspiration from widely used packages such as [`tokio`](https://crates.io/crates/tokio), [`embassy`](https://embassy.dev/), and [`cortex-m`](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cortex-m). This gives you a realistic look into the embedded and async Rust scene while also offering practical experience.

vexide projects are just regular Rust projects. By using vexide, you gain full access to the entirety of the [crates.io](https://crates.io/) ecosystem's 150,000+ packages to use in your code. [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), Rust's package manager makes it extremely easy to install third-party libraries and integrate them into your project. Even `vexide` itself is just another library that's installed through Cargo!

## Safety, Predictability, and Fault Tolerance

![message boxes depicting various memory errors](/docs/aborts.svg)

Rust as a language aims to make it as difficult as possible to write unpredictable software that fails at runtime. This is especially important when programming robots. Many competitors can attest to the truth of [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law). **If something works 99.5% of the time, but very rarely fails unexplainably, then it isn't worth using at all.**

Likewise, programming in an environment that makes it exceedingly easy to shoot yourself in the foot isn't much better either. vexide is designed to encourage safe programming practices, such as memory safety and explicit, result-oriented error handling, while often completely preventing common pitfalls like race conditions and undefined behavior. **This decreases the risk of something going wrong when it matters the most, while also making you a better programmer in the process.** Often times, if your program compiles, you can be reasonably confident it will function.

vexide also takes [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) very seriously. **It should not be possible to cause memory errors in vexide when only using safe Rust.** If you ever encounter anything along the lines of a `Memory Permission Error`, `Prefetch Error`, or `Undefined Error` in your program with no `unsafe` code, then this is immediately considered a serious and high-priority bug in vexide itself.

> [!TIP]
> TL;DR â€” if something goes terribly wrong in your program, you should ideally have only yourself to blame.

## vexide is *fully* Open Source

![hearts](/docs/hearts.svg)

vexide is one of the only VEX programming environments that is developed entirely in the open. This means that anyone is free to contribute to, research, modify, or build vexide themselves from [its source code on GitHub](http://github.com/vexide/vexide). vexide and its associated tools are [MIT licensed](https://github.com/vexide/vexide/blob/main/LICENSE) and do not link to proprietary code or SDKs by default.

vexide's development is entirely community-driven, meaning it is not maintained by a single person or entity. Many active VRC and VEX U competitors from around the world have submitted bug reports and patches to vexide. This model of development promotes a level of transparency and community involvement that isn't seen anywhere else.

## Hardware APIs and Documentation

vexide's goal regarding hardware is to support as many devices as possible with as much functionality as possible while providing consistent and reliable interfaces for programmers. For example, vexide provides support for many rarely-used legacy sensors and the [V5 Electromagnet](https://docs.rs/vexide-devices/latest/vexide_devices/smart/electromagnet/struct.Electromagnet.html), despite it being illegal in competition use.

We also aim to be as consistently well-documented as possible. Our [API reference](https://docs.rs/vexide) contains detailed descriptions and examples for every type, function, and constant you can use. Our end-goal is to be more comprehensive than official documentation from VEX. Information has been collected from multiple sources, including the [BLRS Wiki](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/), first-party testing, and fragmented sources such as comments made on [VEXforum](https://www.vexforum.com/).
