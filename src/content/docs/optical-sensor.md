The V5 Optical Sensor is a combination of an ambient light, color, proximity, and gesture sensor. Optical sensors report data about the light intensity, color, and proximity of a single point within their field of view. The sensor is also able to detect hand gestures in four directions.

Because of their color sensing capabilities, Optical Sensors are most often used in sorting mechanisms.
