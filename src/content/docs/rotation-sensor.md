The V5 rotation sensor is a through-bore [rotary encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder) that uses the [hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) to measure the position, angle, and angular velocity of a rotating shaft passing through it.

Rotation sensors provide data with more accuracy and higher resolution compared to the integrated encoders in [Motors](/docs/motor), which makes them ideal for measuring rotating mechanisms like lifts, flywheels, and tracking wheels.
