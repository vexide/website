title: Using The Terminal

One of the most useful debugging tools available to you is the terminal, which allows you to print live data from the brain to your computer as your program runs.

# `print` and `println`

The easiest way to send some data to the terminal in a vexide program is through the `print` family of macros. You might recall `println` from our "Hello World" example:

```rs
use vexide::prelude::*;

#[vexide::main]
async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
    // @focus
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

That will send `Hello World!` followed by a newline to your computer over a USB or bluetooth connection. This is useful in cases where you need to quickly view or debug a value on the brain, or send some logs over for future use.

We also have a `print` macro, which is the same as `println` except it won't end your message in a newline.

```rs
// @fold start
use vexide::prelude::*;

// @fold end
#[vexide::main]
async fn main(peripherals: Peripherals) {
    print!("Hello");
    print!("Hello");
}
```

That will send the data `HelloHello` to your computer.

# Reading the Terminal

> That's cool and all but... where am I supposed to be seeing all this?

Simply running all of this code with no connection to a computer won't visibly do anything, so let's change that.

Terminal data can be read over a USB connection to a V5 brain or controller using `cargo-v5` (one of the [prerequisites](../prerequisites/) that you should already have installed). To open a terminal connection with the brain, we'll simply run the following command:

```sh
cargo v5 terminal
```

When you run your program, you should be greeted by vexide's startup banner along with the output of `print`/`println`.

# Disabling the vexide Banner

In the video above, vexide printed a startup banner along with your `Hello world!` message. If you don't want this banner to be printed, you can disable this in your program:

```rs
// @fold start
use vexide::prelude::*;

// @fold end
//             (                    )
#[vexide::main(banner(enabled = false))]
async fn main(_peripherals: Peripherals) {
    println!("Look ma! No banners!");
}
```

# Low-level Standard I/O: `Stdin` and `Stdout`

`print!` and `println!` are *macros*, meaning they expand to some larger block of code at compile-time. If you're familiar with Rust, you've probably used them before in other programs to print out some program output. There are a few subtle differences in the behavior of vexide's printing macros from what you'd encounter in `std`'s versions though.

To understand this behavior, lets look into what underlying APIs these macros actually expand to:

<div class="code-split">

```rs
println!("Hello world!");
```

```rs
{
    use ::vexide::io::{Write, stdout};
    if let Err(e) = stdout().write_fmt(format_args!("Hello world!")) {
        panic!("failed printing to stdout: {e}");
    }
}
```

</div>

The brain communicates with your computer through two buffers: [`Stdin`](https://docs.rs/vexide-core/latest/vexide_core/io/struct.Stdin.html) and [`Stdout`](https://docs.rs/vexide-core/latest/vexide_core/io/struct.Stdout.html). `Stdout`, or "standard output" is what's being used to print our "Hello world!" message here, as it represents the outgoing message from the brain to your computer.

> [!NOTE]
> `Stdout` is part of vexide's [`io`](https://docs.rs/vexide-core/latest/vexide_core/io/index.html) API.

## Example: Printing Without Macros

To manually print to `Stdout` we can write to its buffer by obtaining a *lock*, which will give us exclusive access to the buffer until we release the lock (either by explicitly `drop`ping it or having it fall out of scope). This ensures that we won't get interrupted by another print attempt while we are writing to our buffer.

[`StdoutLock`](https://docs.rs/vexide-core/latest/vexide_core/io/struct.StdoutLock.html) implements the [`Write`](https://docs.rs/vexide-core/latest/vexide_core/io/trait.Write.html) trait, which provides some methods for writing to the buffer:

```rs
// @fold start
use vexide::prelude::*;
// @fold end
use vexide::io::{Write, stdout};

#[vexide::main]
async fn main(_peripherals: Peripherals) {
    let lock = stdout().lock();
//                    ^
//        [Obtain a lock of Stdout.]
  
    lock.write(b"Hello World!\n").unwrap();
    
    core::mem::drop(lock);
//                 ^
// [Bring the lock out of scope to release it.]
}
```

# Advanced Logging Solutions

vexide takes a fairly unopinionated approach on how you should use the terminal, providing a similar API surface to what's given to you in normal rust programs in a `std`-environment through macros and writers. If you need a more advanced logging solution, crates in the rust ecosystem such as [log](https://crates.io/crates/log) may be of interest to you.
